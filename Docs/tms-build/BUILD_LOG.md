# TMS build log

One entry per unit of work (newest first). Decisions needed from Ryne go under **Decision needed**.

## 2026-10-27 — Step A deployed successfully on dev

- Commit `36858b9` pushed to `origin dev` (Customer v2 — status ladder, credit controls, contacts/billing/quoting defaults). Amplify dev job `7` for commit `36858b9acf023815a23ea1d229ab3391741cfe1a` status `SUCCEED`.
- Required gates passed: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint` (3 pre-existing warnings), `npm run test` (3290 tests passed). Final Fable review blockers fixed before commit.
- Verification: authenticated dev browser Customers board, profile tabs, org-default editor, status actions, and credit exposure verified against 98 copied customers.
- **Decision needed:** harness has no registered `plan` agent. Main approved the same Fable model through `reviewer` with a planning-only assignment; continue that mapping per step. Customer hard-delete/merge remains a future decision; inactive records are retained.

## 2026-10-27 — Step A implementation in progress (not shipped)

- Fable architecture plan: `Docs/tms-build/A-plan.md`; additive Customer/TmsSettings extension, status/credit actions, typed client and customer board/profile. Lead corrections retain all legacy exposure, forbid inferred invoicing/payment, and include markup and contact/quoting defaults.
- Shared types/math/client slice landed in six files. Lead fixed legacy-name matching when normalizedName is absent and strengthened the attribution fixture. Lead ran `npx vitest run src/lib/customerCredit.test.ts`: **47 passed**. Backend/schema and UI slices completed with scoped proof.
- Baseline: existing ahead commit `5f8aeb6` contains only brief/log. Amplify dev job `6`, commit `37de60b`, reached `SUCCEED`. Count-only dev scans confirmed 98 copied customers and 890 loads; no refresh needed.
- Runtime verification prepared: authenticated dev browser displays Customers 98 and Loads 890; authenticated dev AppSync schema introspection succeeded against the dev API. A temporary suppressed-invite dev test identity is retained only for smoke checks and will be removed afterward. No production writes or PII-file access.
